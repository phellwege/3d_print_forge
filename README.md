### About
this app is a community of 3d printing enthusiasts. 
- They can upload STL files in exchange for a percent of their sales
- As well as offer custom printing solutions (there will be a google calender with a set time frame to produce each print. Each account will have the number of printers registered so if they have multiples their grace period will remain the same during a set period of time until the number of printers has been exceeded.)

- commission split is 10% of each transaction or $0.50, whichever is greater. the rest goes to the creator.
